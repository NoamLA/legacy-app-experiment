# Legacy Interview App

A lean, experimental storytelling and memory-preservation platform that captures personal legacies through AI-driven, collaborative interviews using Agno's multi-agent system.

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a **minimal viable structure** designed for investigating and experimenting with the Legacy Interview App flow and AI agents. It provides a working foundation to test core concepts before building the full production system.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Driven Interviews**: Smart follow-up questions generated by Agno agents
- **👥 Family Collaboration**: Framework for assigning questions to family members
- **📄 Multiple Outputs**: Transform interviews into narratives, quotes, and structured content
- **🔄 Progressive Flow**: Guided interview process from seed questions to deep themes

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for modern UI
- **Backend**: Agno multi-agent system with FastAPI
- **AI Agents** (powered by OpenAI GPT-4o): 
  - **Planner Agent**: Generates contextual seed questions and identifies themes
  - **Prober Agent**: Creates adaptive follow-up questions during interviews
  - **Summarizer Agent**: Compiles responses into engaging narratives

## 🚀 Quick Start

**See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# 2. Set up environment (add your OpenAI API key)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start backend (Terminal 1)
python start-backend.py

# 4. Start frontend (Terminal 2) 
./start-frontend.sh

# 5. Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔄 Interview Flow (Experimental)

1. **📝 Project Creation**: Set up interview subject and family context
2. **❓ Seed Questions**: AI generates 15-20 warm-up questions for rapport
3. **🎯 Theme Identification**: AI analyzes responses to find key life themes  
4. **🔍 Deep Dive**: Explore themes with targeted follow-up questions
5. **📖 Summarization**: Generate narratives, timelines, and memorable quotes

## 🧪 What You Can Test

- **Agent Behavior**: How Agno agents generate and adapt questions
- **User Flow**: Complete interview process from start to finish
- **Theme Detection**: AI's ability to identify meaningful life themes
- **Response Quality**: How well the system handles various answer types
- **Export Formats**: Different ways to present the collected stories

## 🔧 Customization Points

- **Question Styles**: Modify agent prompts in `backend/agents/`
- **UI/UX**: Customize React components and Tailwind styles
- **Export Formats**: Add new output types in `summarizer_agent.py`
- **Interview Modes**: Extend family collaboration features

## 🎯 Next Development Steps

This lean structure is designed to validate core concepts. Based on experimentation results:

1. **Enhanced AI Agents**: Refine question generation and theme detection
2. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent data
3. **Voice Integration**: Add real speech-to-text capabilities  
4. **Family Collaboration**: Build real-time assignment and notification system
5. **Export Pipeline**: Create production-ready podcast, PDF, and web outputs
6. **Authentication**: Add user accounts and family group management

## 📚 Documentation

- **Setup Guide**: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) - Detailed installation and testing instructions
- **API Documentation**: Available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when backend is running
- **Agno Framework**: [docs.agno.com](https://docs.agno.com) for agent development

## 💡 Experimentation Focus

Use this lean structure to:
- Test the interview flow and user experience
- Evaluate AI agent performance and question quality
- Validate the theme identification and summarization process
- Experiment with different interview modes and family collaboration approaches
- Assess the overall concept viability before full development

This foundation provides everything needed to investigate the Legacy Interview App concept while maintaining a clean, extensible codebase.
