      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "I think my earliest memory when I was a baby, family was having dinner and in the kitchen next to the living room where we had a fireplace because that was the only heat we had."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "And they put me in a big rocking chair in front of the fireplace and I had never said a word. I was three months old and I hadn't made a sound in my life. And all of a sudden while they're eating dinner, I let out a yell and they thought that the fire had burned me."

    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Great-Granddaughter",
      "text": "Okay, so next question. What do you think about today's technology compared to kind of the technology that you had when you were growing up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "Well, I think it's amazing the technology that we have and when you think about what it can be in the future. And somebody said to me the other day, what do you think is going to happen in the next generation, the next hundred years? And I said, oh, I think your second home will be on the moon. Probably."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "The best advice I think was from my parents, my mother and my father. It was taking your own business and letting everybody else do their thing. I was born and raised on a farm and all they grew was cotton and corn."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "And the only foods that we bought was flour and meal. We had our own chickens, our own cows, horses. They had a hen house."

      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "The hens went in a house to lay their eggs and my job was to pick up the eggs every day and bring them to the house."

      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "When I graduated from high school, it was during the Great Depression in the 1930s and I needed a job. And I got a job as a waitress making a dollar a day and my uniforms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "And my father came to see me about three weeks later and he said, Mary, how much money do you make? And proudly I said, a dollar a day and my uniforms. And he said, you know what you do with 10 cents of that dollar don't you? You give it to charity. And I said, but I've only got a dollar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "He said, would it make a difference when you wake up in the morning whether you have 90 cents or you have a dollar? And that has stuck with me for over 80 years."

      "speaker": "Gigi (Mary Shane Bird)",
      "text": "Well, we lived in the country so you didn't know very much about style."
